Basic REST API for interacting with Docker containers


*Note to readers*
Doesn't contain unit testing or my usual level of polish or comments because I wasn't sure how much time vs quality is valued in this exercise.
Especially relevant because I went on a pretty deep rabbit hole trying to put together an openAPI spec and auto-generate a spring boot app from that.
I've done that before; But, couldn't quite get the result to build here so I changed tactics and went with something simpler.
